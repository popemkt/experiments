- Key takeaways
    - Provide default implementation in interfaces
    - Must be **casted** to appropriate Interface to use such method
    - Enables **traits** programming
    - Can be reabstracted, ie. abstracted by derived interface
- Pros
    - Easier inheritance behaviour modeling
    - Better support for multi-inheritance
    - Allowed
        - member declarations that declare constants, operators, static constructors, and nested types;
        - a  __body__  for a method or indexer, property, or event accessor (that is, a "default" implementation);
        - member declarations that declare static fields, methods, properties, indexers, and events;
        - member declarations using the explicit interface implementation syntax; and
        - Explicit access modifiers (the default access is `public`).
- Limitations
